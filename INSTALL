Dependencies
==================
The following are the basic requirements for the library. Also see CMakeLists.txt for a more detailed list.
pangomm-1.4
cairomm-1.0
boost

Under debian testing (and therefore probably under ubuntu) one needs to install:
libboost-date-time-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-math-dev libpangomm-1.4-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-util0-dev


Basic Installation
==================
Run:
cmake .
make install

The library is currently only tested to build on my gentoo installation, so if you find any problems please contact me and I'll try to address them.
