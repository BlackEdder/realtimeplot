Dependencies
==================
The following are the basic requirements for the library. Also see CMakeLists.txt for a more detailed list.
pangomm-1.4
cairomm-1.0
boost

Under debian testing (and therefore probably under ubuntu) one needs to install:
libboost-date-time-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-math-dev libpangomm-1.4-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-util0-dev

Old xcb-util libraries:
(i.e. pre ubuntu 11.10)
Older versions of xcb-util were divided into multiple separate libraries. Now they are all part of one library (libxcb-util.so). The build system currently only handles the newer version. It should be possible to install the library using the older implementation, but (since I don't use such a system) this is currently not supported (patches are welcome though :) ).
Reportedly in Ubuntu 11.04 it is possible to install the libxcb-util0-devs from 11.10:
- libxcb-util0-dev: http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/libxcb-util0-dev 
- libxcb-util0: http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/libxcb-util0


Basic Installation
==================
Run:
cmake .
make install
