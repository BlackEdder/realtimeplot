* properly justify tick labels (pango support?)
* remove flickering (could be done by drawing axes and plots to another (intermediate) imagesurface and then draw that on xlibsurface in one go)
* Use mouse to drag around (a paused) image
* Use a key to start (and stop) recording to a png file
* Make minimal framerate higher than once a second
* Allow zoom in/zoom out
* Better x/y tick labels choices (probably with a smart multiplication and round.. i.e if range is 1 from (0.01,..,0.99)*10, round(0.1,1.1,..) -> (1,2,3,4,..)/10 ->0.1,0.2,...)
