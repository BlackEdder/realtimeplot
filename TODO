* Implement adaptive plot (x/yrange is determined by first "x" number of events)
		Probably by redrawing it the first x number of events.
* Find out if segmentation fault within screen can be dealt with more gracefully 
		(segmentation fault also seems to happen when display = false)
* Histogram and Histogram3D should also plot outside the axes, so move
	works properly
* Provide a combine method that easily allows you to combine one plot with another
	* Probably need to make plot surface transparent
* PDF backend
* Mouse wheel zoom should zoom around the current position
* Use a key to start (and stop) recording to a png file
* Allow multiple data sets in one histogram/histogram3d plot
* GTK backend?
