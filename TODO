* properly justify tick labels (pango support?)
* remove flickering (could be done by drawing axes and plots to another (intermediate) imagesurface and then draw that on xlibsurface in one go)
* Use mouse to drag around (a paused) image
* Use a key to start (and stop) recording to a png file
* Allow zoom in/zoom out
