* Histogram and Histogram3D should also plot outside the axes, so move
	works properly
* Mouse input
* Provide a combine method that easily allows you to combine one plot with another
	* Probably need to make plot surface transparent
* PDF backend
* Use a key to start (and stop) recording to a png file
* Allow multiple data sets in one histogram/histogram3d plot
* GTK backend?
