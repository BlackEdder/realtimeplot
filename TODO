* Histogram and Histogram3D should also plot outside the axes, so move
	works properly
* Provide a combine method that easily allows you to combine one plot with another
	* Probably need to make plot surface transparent
* PDF backend
* Mouse wheel zoom should zoom around the current position
* Zoom should not zoom to far (the pPlotArea->max/min_x/y should always 
		encompass config.min/max_x/y)
* Use a key to start (and stop) recording to a png file
* Allow multiple data sets in one histogram/histogram3d plot
* GTK backend?
