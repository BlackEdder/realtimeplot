* Plot.reset seems not to work (probably adaptive plot related). For example in benchmark I can't
	use pl.reset( new_config ); to run the next benchmark.
* Add benchmarks
	* Stress test, number of points handled per minute.
	* Frame rate (should be relatively constant?)
	* Benchmarks for each different plot
	* Try sysprof/oprofile?
* Add tests for delaunay and square grid (I know something goes wrong, want to add test 	that catches that)
* Play more with axes etc. Test axes output etc.
* Find out if segmentation fault within screen can be dealt with more gracefully 
		(segmentation fault also seems to happen when display = false)
* Histogram and Histogram3D should also plot outside the axes, so move
	works properly
* Provide a combine method that easily allows you to combine one plot with another
	* Probably need to make plot surface transparent
* PDF backend
* Mouse wheel zoom should zoom around the current position
* Use a key to start (and stop) recording to a png file
* Allow multiple data sets in one histogram/histogram3d plot
* GTK backend?
